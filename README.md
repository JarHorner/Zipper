# Zipper
A small application that zips and unzips.
I started this project to recall my Java knowledge and use certain technologies I have never used before.

## Usage

By using Maven, Once the code is cloned, the program should run fine right away.

## Acknowledgements

This project uses JavaFX, an open source client application platform for desktop, mobile and embedded systems built on Java with the goal of producing a modern, 
efficient, and fully featured toolkit for developing rich client applications.

It also incorporates Apache Maven, a software project management and comprehension tool I though would be useful to learn.
